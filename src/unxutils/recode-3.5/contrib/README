* README file for `recode/contrib/'.		-*- outline -*- (allout)

.* Hi, people!

   The `contrib/' directory of the `recode' distribution contains a few
   miscellaneous tools, ports, or such things, which have been collected
   here and there, a bit randomly, for your possible entertainment or use.

   Beware that nothing here is supported by the `recode' maintainer, you
   might have to contact the authors directly to get support.  There is no
   guarantee that any file in this directory will still exist in subsequent
   releases.  Finally, there is no guarantee either that I will accept
   to include contributions, unless I find them very good or very small.
   But I'm quite willing to give URL pointers to other tools, right here!

.* Included files

   To the best of my knowledge, all included files are free, and already
   available widely by other means.  I did not collect any kind legalistic
   papers proving that the contained material is indeed free.  In case of
   a dispute, or at the mere request of the author, I'll quickly remove
   any dubious material.  So, do not consider the files here as being as
   *safe* as the things you usually get from the Free Software Foundation.

   Please drop me a note about what you found to be useful, in here,
   to help me at deciding what should be kept and what should go away.
