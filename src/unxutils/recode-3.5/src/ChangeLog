	used in the computed translation table.  It was ignored.

	Reported by Nicolas Anquetil.

	* ltexlat1.l: Ensure that recode does not match only part of the
	identifier following `\'.  This was easily solved by adding a few
	Flex rules at end and relying on the Flex longest match law.
	For example, because Latin-1 misses the latin `oe' diphtong (!),
	`\oe' was seen as the recodable `\o' followed by an isolated `e'.
	Reported by Mac Pigman and Nicolas Anquetil.

	* ltexlat1.l: Reformatted for a more uniform Flex quoting.

1994-01-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Version 3.3.1, in the MSDOS world only.

	* all: Everywhere, change charset names from latin1 to Latin-1,
	latex to LaTeX and texte to Texte.  Change applemac to Apple-Mac,
	ascii-bs to ASCII-BS, atarist to AtariST, bangbang to Bang-Bang,
	cdcnos to CDC-NOS, ebcdic to EBCDIC, ebcdic-ccc to EBCDIC-CCC,
	ebcdic-ibm to EBCDIC-IBM, ibmpc to IBM-PC and iconqnx to Icon-QNX.

	* recode.c: For MSDOS, increase the stack length through _stklen.

	* recode.c: Diagnose more precisely all errors involving errno,
	while calling error.  In particular, include __FILE__:__LINE__.

	* recode.c (main): Unless under MSDOS, use rec<PID>.tmp for the
	file name of the temporary recoded file instead of recodeXX.TMP.

	* recode.c: Rename optimize_sequence to simplify_sequence, and
	optimizable_type to symplify_type.

	* recode.c (execute_popen_sequence): Return 0 if the subprocess
	fails, instead of exiting with a diagnostic.  Pass -f option to
	subprocesses if selected.  Always pass -q to shut them down.
	Construct the popen_command piecemeal instead of a big sprintf.
	(main, usage): Implement option --quiet (-q, --silent).

	* recode.c (execute_pass_sequence): Interrupt the current recoding
	and return 0 if any step fails, if this happens, unlink a possibly
	existing temporary file.

	* recode.c (execute_pipe_sequence): Unconditionnaly close the
	output file from the parent before waiting, instead of closing
	it only if there was an output name.  Let the parent accumulate
	the exit status of all children before returning its own.
	* configure.in: Let HAVE_PIPE be defined.  This old bug ig gone!

	* recode.c (perform_auto_check, perform_auto_check_one): Renamed
	and split from function report_about_all_sequences.  Now accepts a
	CHARSET	argument for limiting the search.
	(main): Allows an optional command line argument to --auto.
	(usage): Adjusted accordingly.

	* recode.c (main): Diagnose extraneous arguments to --list.

	* recode.c (compare_struct_item): New.
	(init_recode_rfc1345): Partial rewrite for replacing the quadratic

1994-01-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* txtelat1.l: Undo the 1990-03-15 change.  If there is still a bug
	in this area, I will let it show its nose again...

	* mergelex.awk: Remove the X_ prefix for start condition names.

	* configure.in: Remove all about LEXLIB, flexlib and LIBOBJS,
	since flex (version 2.4.6) generated scanners are self contained.
	* flexlib.c: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* recode.c (optimizable_type): New, from optimize_sequence.
	(optimize_sequence): Use it.

	* charset.c (clean_charset_name): Set decoding_charset_flag just
	before calling usage instead of early, do not care resetting it.

	* next.c: Renamed from nextstep.c.  NeXTSTEP changed to NeXT.  Add
	f2 as florin (166) and '" as hungarian umlaut (205).  Remove
	USE_DOUBLE_STEP by making the code permanent, remove older code.
	* charname.pl: Especially define f2 as florin.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.
	Reported by Keld Jørn Simonsen.

	* alloca.c: Deleted, not used anymore.

	* Makefile.in (.stamp-collect): Say when initstep.h altered.

	* charset.pl: Now produce split charset1.c and charset2.c instead
	of a single big charset.h.  This seems mandatory for MSDOS, even
	with huge model.  Some Unix C compilers will crawl faster, too.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* README.DOS: New file.
	* configdos.pl: Much revised.  The script no longer have a
	config.tcc input, now taking its information from Makefile.in.
	* dosfn: New file, from elsewhere.
	* dosfn.pl: New file, common between configdos.pl and dosfn.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute configdos.pl again, together with
	dosfn.pl and makefile.dos.  Adapt for MSDOS and configdos.pl.

	* recode.c: Delete inactive code for selecting DEFAULT_CHARSET,
	this being now done from configure or by already preset config.h.

	* atarist.c: Rewritten for using a double step, instead of two
	steps in and out latin1; the new code is triggered by defining
	USE_DOUBLE_STEP, the old code will be kept for a little while.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* Makefile.in: Do not define LDFLAGS, use CFLAGS on link calls.
	* configure.in: Remove LDEFS substitution, seemingly unused.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

1994-01-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	(execute_popen_sequence): Return 1 (unfinished).
	(execute_pipe_sequence): Return 1 (unfinished).
	(execute_sequence): Return the status got from execute_*_sequence,
	use it to alter "done" into "DENIED" when using -v.
	(declare_step): Adjust file_recode parameter declaration.
	(main):  Have --graphics imply --force.
	* recode.h: Adjust declarations.  Declare error, force_option.

	recode "!!J" or "!!j" into '\n' unless -f.
	* cdcnos.c (file_cdcnos_ascii): Similarily.  Also, do not recode
	"^)" into '\n' unless -f.
	* flat.c (file_ascii_flat): Similarily.
	* ibmpc.c (file_latin1_ibmpc, file_ibmpc_latin): Similarily.
	Also, do not recode isolated '\n' or '^Z' unless -f.
	* iconqnx.c (file_ibmpc_iconqnx, file_iconqnx_ibmpc): Similarily.
	Also, check for preventing the production of a few sequences which
	would might be recoded back differently, unless -f.
	* mergelex.awk: Similarily for generated file_<step_name>
	routines.  Return the yylex result.  At <<EOF>>, return 1.

	* charset.c (make_argmatch_array): Print a line of hash statistics
	if HASH_STATS is defined.

	I used to have 408 names in 343/997 buckets, the following patch
	gave 408 names in 332/997 buckets.  Being worse, I commented it.
	* charset.c (hash_string): Replace hash algorithm by GNU diff's.
	* recode.h: Include <limits.h> and ensure CHAR_BIT is defined.

	(report_about_all_sequences): Simplify detection of one_to_same.

	* Makefile.in: Distribute .stamp-collect and initstep.h.  This
	should alleviate problems caused by some sh/sed combinations,
	still unstudied, which are unable to make initstep.h properly.
	Reported by Michael L. Dowling.

1993-12-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* flat.c: Consider `~' as a diacritic character.
	* File-Latin1: New file, intended to help testing/playing.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute File-Latin1.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

1993-12-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (merged.c): Split the pipe in parts, because
	otherwise all status except the last of the pipe are lost for
	make.  This is seemingly a feature of sh.
	Reported by Vern Paxson.

1993-12-25  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for vprintf and strerror, for error.c.

1993-12-21  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *.c: Delete unused variables, add a few missing const's.

	* nextstep.c: Rewritten for using a double step, instead of two
	steps in and out latin1; the new code is triggered by defining
	USE_DOUBLE_STEP, the old code will be kept for a little while.
	This has two advantages: recode can obey various -l options for
	NeXTSTEP, and I can remove the full style table from the
	documentation.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Also delete unhexify.

	* Makefile.in (tags): Include $(HEADERS).
	(TAGS): Idem.  Also use -t on etags.

	* charset.pl: Send diagnostics to stderr instead of charset.LOG.

	* charset.pl: Discard &duplicate lines without discarding the
	associated charset.

	* charset.pl: Canonalize names the same way charset.c does, detect
	duplicate names or aliases based on canonical names.  Do not
	discard a charset merely for an alias name clash.

	*charset.pl: Delay the generation of charset.texi, sort the
	@item's by charset name and, within each, sort aliases.

	* recode.h: Add a size field to the charset structure, declare a
	size parameter to declare_double_step.
	* charset.pl: Handle charsets having more than 2 characters per
	symbol, transmit measured size into declare_double_step calls.
	* recode.c (declare_double_step): Accept and save a size parameter.
	* charset.c (code_to_symbol): New routine for handling size field.
	(list_full_charset, list_concise_charset): Adapt to using it.

1993-12-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* charset.c: Add cleanup_charset_name, use it in find_charset,
	declare_alias and decode_charset_name.  Rename compare_hash_name
	to compare_struct_hash.

	because it has been cleaned up.
	Reported by Keld Jørn Simonsen.

1993-12-14  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* charset.pl: Generating charset.h instead of charset.c.
	* charset.c: New.
	* recode.c (prepare_charset_initialization): New.
	(hash_string, find_charset, declare_alias, make_argmatch_array,
	decode_charset_name, compare_hash_name, list_all_charsets,
	list_full_charset, list_concise_charset): Moved into charset.c,
	together with a few defines, struct hash and related declarations.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

1993-12-13  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.
	* recode.h: Add declaration for charname_to_comment.
	* recode.c: list_charsets renamed to list_all_charsets.
	New functions list_full_charset and list_concise_charset, enum and
	variable list_format.  Decode the list format, check for a charset
	argument and switch to the proper listing function.

	* acconfig.h: New, for holding DEFAULT_CHARSET.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute it, have .stamp-h.in depend on it.
	* configure.in: Substitute DEFAULT_CHARSET instead of DEFCHARSET.

	* configure.in: Include $LEXLIB in $LIBS when $LEX is flex, so the
	yy_flex_alloc test will not always fail, waiting for a version of
	Autoconf which will do this itself.
	* Makefile.in: Do not add @LEXLIB@ to LIBS anymore.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* checkit: Replace `+' by `*' in grep calls.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* recode.c (usage): Replace --include by --header in text.

1993-12-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c (list_charsets): Move all aliases of a charset after
	the true charset name on its line, keeping lines sorted on the
	true charset name and all alias in lexicographical order.  All
	charset and aliases used to be sorted together, one per line.
	(compare_hash_names): Sort accordingly.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Add make_argmatch_array and decode_charset_name.  Use
	them, simplifying decode_before_after.  Process ignored_charset
	even for the -a option.  Add print_truncated_charset_name and use
	it to simplify report_about_all_sequences, not reporting an
	unachievable recoding when ignored_charset is specified.

	* recode.c (find_sequence): Ensure verbose is executed even if no
	path has been found, instead of returning early.

	* recode.c (optimize_sequence): Remove the compute_arrays
	parameter, because report_about_all_sequences now studies the
	produced arrays.  Callers changed.

	* recode.c (optimize_sequence): While merging rfc1345 steps, also
	merge qualities instead of assuming REVERSIBLE.
	Reported by Rejean Payette.

	* recode.h: Declare strict_mapping.
	* recode.c (complete_pairs): Do not set quality, this is done
	elsewhere in all cases.  But do preset the file recoding routine.
	* applemac.c, atarist.c, nextstep.c: In declare_step calls, lower
	the recoding quality to some *_TO_MANY whenever strict mapping is
	in use, also specify NULL as the file recoding routine because
	complete_pairs now initializes it.
	* ibmpc.c: Idem.  But override file_recode after complete_pairs.

	* ibmpc.c (file_latin1_ibmpc, file_ibmpc_latin1): Repeat the
	algorithm, but using the one_to_many table when strict mapping.

	* recode.c (declare_double_step): Create both single steps without
	the help of declare_step, this spares four probes in the charset
	table per call.

1993-12-10  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.h: Add CHARSET and struct charset, use CHARSET *before
	and after instead of int start_charset and goal_charset in STEP,
	declare rfc1345 as CHARSET * instead of int, delete struct
	double_link and rfc1345_link declaration and rather include the
	DOUBLE_TABLE right in CHARSET, add a DOUBLE_TABLE parameter to
	declare_double_step,
	* recode.c: Make all necessary related changes.  Renaming of many
	variables and cleanup, too numerous to report here.  Delete
	name_from_value and ignored_array in favor of new CHARSET fields.

	* recode.c: Change :rfc1345 to rfc1345.  Add `.' as an alias.
	(report_about_all_sequences): Avoid rfc1345 instead of avoiding
	names beginning with colon.

	* applemac.c: Renamed (once again) from macintosh.c.  The codes
	will be kept different until further study.  Comment out the
	aliasing of applemac to macintosh.
	* ibmpc.c: Comment out the aliasing of ibmpc to ibm437, because
	making the codes equivalent requires further study.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* recode.c: Implement --ignore (-x) option and ignored_array.
	(find_charset): Progressively initialize ignored_array to zero.
	(find_sequence): Ignore steps with an ignored start charset.
	(decode_before_after): Process the ignored charset.

	* recode.c (usage): Make the output little more legilable through
	spacing.  Insist on -l, mention the Info documentation, propose a
	few selected charsets.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Rename make_include_mode into make_header_mode,
	include_name into header_name, output_include_file into
	output_header_file, turn --include option name into --header.

	* recode.c: Add before_name and after_name, use them in
	decode_before_after and in output_header_file.  This prevents
	the spurious canonalization of alias charset names.

	* recode.c: Implement --strict (-s) option.
	(complete_pairs): Accept a step parameter and slip the generated
	table in it instead of returning the table.  Adjust for --strict.
	(init_recode_rfc1345): Adjust for complete_pairs.
	* atarist.c, macintosh.c, nextstep.c: Idem.
	* ibmpc.c: Idem.  Also rewrite code for --graphics (-g).

	diaeresis_char.
	* ibmpc.c: Delete the ascii_graphics declaration.
	* lat1ltex.c, ltexlat1.l: Delete the diacritics_only declaration.
	* ascilat1.l, txtelat1.l: Delete the diaeresis_char declaration.
	* mergelex.awk: Have it work when there is no %{ ... %}	part.

	* recode.c (report_about_all_sequences): Report charsets which are
	dynamically discoverd to recode identically by "ONE to SAME".

	* recode.c: Declare HASH_TABLE_SIZE, hash_string.  Rewrite
	find_charset and declare_alias to use hashing.  Also adjust
	list_charsets and decode_before_after.

1993-12-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c: Delete name_from_value function, replace with an
	array of same name.  Delete field refer from struct charset,
	initialize and use name_from_value instead.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Remove *.a, for librec.a.
	Reported by Pierre Gaumond.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Move in *.o from mostlyclean.

	* rfc1345.pl: Print progress on stderr, for entertaining me.
	Document aliases in rfc1345.texi through English sentences.

1993-12-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* flexlib.c: New, for -lfl does not work everywhere.
	* mergelex.awk: Produce a yywrap function in section 3.

	Reported by Pierre Gaumond.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Remove config.h.

	* bangbang.c, cdcnos.c: Use "while (x = y, x != z)" instead of
	"while ((x = y) != z)".

	* install.sh: Attach execute permission to this file.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	* lat1ltex.c: Produce {\i} instead of \i{}.  It's nicer.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	* recode.c: Declare argmatch.  Default charsets were not obeyed.
	(decode_before_after): When DEFAULT_CHARSET is defined, use it
	instead of the empty string when calling argmatch.
	(find_charset): Do not check for empty strings anymore.

1993-12-07  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (install): Add recode.info in dependencies.

	* recode.c: Use USE_TMPNAM to bracket out old tmpnam code out and
	USE_TMPFILE to allow in new tmpfile code.
	(execute_pass_sequence):  Use tmpfile instead of tmpnam.
	Reported by Bastian Schlueter (suggests that -i => -o on NeXT).
	Reported by Ronald C.F. Antony.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* recode.c (output_include_file): Ensure a valid C identifier for
	the table name.  RFC 1345 uses bizarre names in that respect.

	* recode.c (main): While moving the new file over the original,
	properly diagnose any failure.
	Reported by David Lebel.

	* recode.c: Add decoding_charset_flag.

	* recode.c (echo_sequence): Use a shorter print format, now that
	we have real long charset names...

	* recode.c: Revert to using a `struct charset' to handle names and
	alias.  Turn charset_name into true_charset_name and charset_value
	into find_charset.

	* Makefile.in (LIBOBJS): Put more on the second line, because if
	@LIBOBJS@ is substituted empty, some make's barf at last `\'.
	(recode.dvi): TEXI2DVI was mispelled.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Implement --list (-l) to alleviate Usage message.

	remaining single step which uses :rfc1345 explicitely.
	(register_all_modules): Make latin1 an alias for iso-8859-1-1987.
	(report_about_all_sequences): Truncate the charset
	names as needed, avoid considering charsets named `:*' alone.

	* ascilat1.l, cdcnos.c, ebcdic.c, flat.c, lat1asci.c: Change name
	of ascii charset to ascii-bs, keeping it separate from RFC 1345.
	* ibmpc.c: Make ibmpc an alias for ibm437.
	* Makefile.in (check): Adjusted for ascii-bs.

	As a side result of all this, more charsets are supported.

	merge_qualities.  From STEP, delete the multichar_input,
	multichar_output, loosing and reversible fields.  Add one QUALITY
	argument and two functionnal arguments to declare_step.
	* all: Implement the preceeding changes.

	* recode.h: Use the _((...)) device more systematically.

	"-I$(srcdir)" instead of "-o recode.info".

	* ebcdic.c: Inclusion of GNU dd's "ibm" recoding, with two
	modifications so the recoding becomes reversible.  Removal of
	static inverse tables, dynamically recreate them instead.
	Replacement of cccascii and cdcascii by ascii, use ebcdic-ccc
	instead of ebcdic in the context of disappearing cccascii.
	* recode.c (invert_table): New.

	* recode.c, all $(C_STEPS), all $(L_STEPS): Include "recode.h"
	instead of "config.h".
	* recode.h: New.

	* all $(C_STEPS): Delete "#define STEP <name>", because STEP will

	* iconqnx.c: Merged from ibmpicon.c and iconibmp.c.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	The net effect of all these changes is that charsets or their
	single step methods are now easily configurable out of recode by
	merely deleting them from C_STEPOBJS or L_STEPS in Makefile.
	Reported by Claude Goutier.

1993-12-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* ltexlat1.l: Ensure \'{e} is recognized as \'e.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	Have those messages resembling more to the actual recode calls.
	Remove now useless error identification messages.
	Use "cmp -s" instead of "diff" for comparing files.
	* Makefile.in: Use $(SHELL) instead of sh in CHECKTEST. Remove -v.

1993-11-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* mergelex.awk: Deeply revised.  Now able to merge Flex sources
	having a non-empty section 3.  No more forward declarations for

	saying this is a derived file, followed by the first block comment
	found in any input file.  Produce an output cleaner for the eye.
	* Makefile.in (merged.c): Remove synchronization directives, they
	are useless for now.  Delete new temporary files merged[123].tmp.

	* Makefile.in: In dist goal, ensure 777 mode for directories, so
	older tar's will restore file modes properly.

	* asciflat.c: Remove old commented lex code.  Remove a useless
	`case EOF:' from inner switch, the logic will work anyway.

1993-01-17  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* getopt.c: Use more recent version.
	* getopt.h: New, from elsewhere.

	* recode.c: Replace tempnam by tmpnam.  Always allocate the

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Do not absolutize $(srcdir), because
	this could create problems with automounters.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Remove IF_* devices, they were
	solving a problem caused only by non timestamping shars, and
	recode is now distributed in tar or zoo format.

1991-11-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Get rid of the head program, using sed.  I would
	also like, eventually, to get rid of file and grep programs too.

	* recode.c: Force binary mode on files for MSDOS.

1991-10-27  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Use checkit in check goal.

1991-10-23  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c: Revert back to -v instead of -q.  Give the user some
	more control on the sequencing strategy through -i, -o and -p.
	Get rid of any USE_FILE, USE_POPEN and USE_PIPE.  However, keep
	POPEN_MISSING and PIPE_MISSING around, for MSDOS.  Segregating
	between `popen' and `pipe' is only experimental, while trying to
	have `pipe' working correctly.

	* configure, Makefile.in: New.  Many new configuration features.
	Among others, through IF_FLEX, be careful to never loose merged.c
	on those systems which do not have the machinery to remake it.
	* GNUmakefile, Makefile, Depends: deleted.

1991-03-31  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* mergelex.awk: remove exit() and read() definitions.

1991-01-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* ibmpicon.c, ibmplat1.c, ibmpmaci.c: Recognize old DOS end of
	file (0x1A).

1991-01-21  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* lat1bang.c, lat1txte.c: Have the no-break space converted to a
	single space.

1991-01-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* all: While/if ((var=exp) [test]) -> while/if (var=exp, var [test]),
	switch (var=exp) -> var=exp; switch (var).

	* recode.c (code_index): Use usage_and_exit ().  Moved.
	* recode.c (echo_sequence): Print format changed.
	* recode.c: Issue `recoding FILE ...done' messages, unless -q.

	* ibmplat1.c, lat1ibmp.c, ibmpmaci, maciibmp.c, txteibmp.c:
	While reading MS-DOS files, 0x0D followed by 0x0A is converted
	to an end of line; while writing MS-DOS files, end of lines
	are converted to 0x0D 0x0A.
	* ibmpicon.c, iconibmp.c: While reading QNX files, 0x0E is
	converted to 0x0D 0x0A; while writing QNX files, 0x0D followed
	by 0x0A is converted to 0x0E.

	* txteibmp.l: Deleted.
	* steps.h: Remove references to texte_ibmpc.

	* steps.h: Remove DONT_LEX conditionals; merged.c is always
	available for installation.

1990-07-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* all: Copyright directly assigned to the FSF.

1990-03-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* txteasci.l, txteibmp.l, txtelat1.l: Change occurrences of a NUL
	terminated cursor by a counter from 0 to yyleng-1.  This will
	insure proper transmission of NULs through Flex, which can now
	handle them.

	* mergelex.awk: Make use of -8 option of Flex 2.2 alpha, adjust
	documentation, insure proper pre-declarations of Flex variables
	yytext, yyleng, yyint and yyout.

1990-03-23  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c (execute_popen_sequence): Get rid of unused variables.

	* recode.c (code_index): Change index to counter, because on BSD
	index is a library function.

1990-03-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Version 3.1.

1990-03-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* version.c, recode.c (usage_and_exit): Change -V to -C to give
	the Copyright conditions, print version identification.

	* txtelat1.l: Real strange bug aroud Flex.  I ought to blindly
	remove the specific case of a capital A with a diaeresis to get
	rid of a `NULL in input' Flex diagnostic.  Doing so, I introduce a
	new bug to get rid of another :-(.

	* all: Added missing prototypes declarations, missing void
	specifications for functions, missing const; removed unused
	variables.
	* common.h: New.

1990-02-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c, Makefile: If no files are specified, recode stdin on
	stdout as before.  But if files are specified, each of them is now
	recoded over itself, preserving its time stamps unless -t option
	is used.  To make it work on BSD, split execute_sequence in three,
	get rid of USE_FILES and hide USE_PIPE in the Makefile.  Also, see
	the comment before execute_sequence routines, in recode.c.

	* recode.c (main): Some code for -f, to be written later.

	* recode.c (usage_and_exit): Rewritten.

1990-02-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* recode.c (usage): Added commas to improve readability.

	* lat1bang.c: Have lower case output instead of upper case, this
	is more readable.

1990-02-03  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Version 3.0.1.

	* recode.c: Corrected bugs related to USE_POPEN; recode step path
	is now echoed once, and diaeresis selection is now propagated.

1990-02-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* mergelex.awk: Option USE_FPUTC, so to compile merged.c using
	fputc instead of putc.  It will hopefully ease Apollo C compiler,
	which litterally trashes on merged.c.

1990-01-27  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* all: Adaptation for Flex.  A few yyleng problems short-circuited
	here and there in some .l's.
	* lexcom.c:  Eliminated.
	* mergelex.awk: New, for merging all .l's into a single merged.l.
	This results in a shorter a.out, by a factor of 2 in fact.
	* asciltex.l, ascitxte.l: Slight adjustments needed to escape <'s
	with backslashes.

	* cdcnasci.c, banglat1.c: Too many putc's, simplified to shorten
	the object modules.

	* recode.c: Temporary files were improperly unlinked.  Addition of
	a -q option (quiet), removal of -d (debug): by default, choosen
	step path is printed on stderr.

	* lat1bang.c: Replacement for disappearing ascibang.l.
	* ascibang.l: Removed.

1989-11-19  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* banglat1.c, lat1bang.c, iconibmp.c, cdcnasci.c, ascicdcn.c,
	asciflat.c: Replacements for banglat1.l, ascibang.l, iconibmp.l,
	cdcnasci.l, ascicdcn.l, asciflat.l.  I will get rid of some
	simpler lex routines, to get speed and save space.
	* steps.h, version.c: Various adjustments for the preceeding
	changes.

	* Most files: Removal of the dash to restrict each file name
	into eight character, for MS-DOS.

1989-11-10  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* version.c: Added.

	* recode.c: Provision for -V option.

1989-10-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Version 3.0.

	* txte-lat1.l, lat1-txte.c: Added.

	* txte-ibmp.l: Capital E with acute accent now stays capital in
	all cases.

	* recode.c: Addition of USE_FILES feature for smaller machines.
	PIPE_OUTSIDE renamed to USE_POPEN, PIPE_INSIDE to USE_PIPE.
	Recognition of short keywords.

	* ltex-asci.l, ltex-lat1.l: \$ now correctly translated into $.
