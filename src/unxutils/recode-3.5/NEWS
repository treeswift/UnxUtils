* Version 3.5 - François Pinard, 1999-05.

.* Incompatible changes
. + A double dot `..' should now be used instead of a colon `:'.
. + Option --force (-f) is needed to pursue recoding despite errors.
. + There is no more quoting for special characters within charsets names.
. + Auto check (`-a') and popen (`-o') options have been withdrawn.
. + Some charsets and aliases were deleted, see `Charsets & aliases' below.

.* Extended features
. + Program messages are available in localised form for many languages.
. + Long character names are available in French, if LANGUAGE is set to `fr'.
. + A new request syntax allows for recode chaining, and for surfaces.
. + Option --header-file (-h) accepts a language parameter, and Perl is new.
. + Full charset listings now show the UCS-2 value for characters.
. + Option --known=PAIRS (-k) also accepts octal and hexadecimal numbers.
. + Option --list (-l) better sorts charsets and aliases, also fully written.
. + Charset `RFC1345' implements mnemonic+ascii+38, and is now reversible.
. + HTML is not limited anymore to Latin-1, HTML 4.0 entities are supported.

.* New features
. + Euro support.
. + Updated RFC 1345 set of tables, from Keld Simonsen.
. + Some African charsets and transliterated forms.
. + Conversions for ISO 10646 and Unicode.
. + Combining or explosion of UCS-2 diacriticized characters and ligatures.
. + Implementation of surfaces, see `Surfaces & aliases' below.
. + Mixed mode for recoding only comments and strings in C sources or PO files.
. + A stand-alone recoding library gets installed, often as a shared library.
. + Option --find-subsets (-T) lists charsets which are subsets of another.
. + The library may generate testing data, and study character frequencies.
