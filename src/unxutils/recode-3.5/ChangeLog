* Previous history before unflattening, from version 3.0 and up:

	All kept in src/ChangeLog.

* Previous history as saved from some oldish recode.texi:

August 1988:

	Some tentative new charsets for TeX and texinfo, steps
	merged and made more uniform, usage of Unix pipes
	instead of translating chunks one at a time.

	Loïc Dachary first exposed me to Easy French.  Claude
	Goutier, through numerous discussions, was helpful in
	evaluating various work hypotheses.

July 1988:

	Ported to BSD Unix, bent to meet most GNU standards.

December 1987:

	Ported to Microsoft C, tables frozen instead of being
	computed by auxiliary programs at installation time,
	translation sequences sought at execution time instead
	of built-in in the program.

July 1985:

	Adapted in Turbo-Pascal on an IBM-PC, translation
	tables completely redesigned.  Dropping of CAF, RUB
	and INT support; ASCII now used as a common base.

* Previous history as found in `secours,/s=codes,recode' output:

March 1983:

	Version 2.0.

	Merge of features from all versions.  New extensive
	documentation, in French.  Handling of French for 95
	character CDC printers.

November 1982:

	Version 1.0.

	Modified to handle NOS (NOS 6/12 code), INT (Intercom 8/12
	code), RUB (7.5 characters per word, for tapes), support of
	EBCDIC translations.  Restructuration into a few main
	modules, one of which is CODES.  Made in preparation for
	the Cray-1 at Canadian Meteorological Center.

December 1981:

	Revision of comparison routines for French processing,
	several suggestions from Francine Ouellette.

December 1980:

	A few speedups and improvements.  My own definition of
	extended ASCII, quite compatible with various usages at
	Université de Montréal.

July 1980:

	Module GEN broken into several modules: ASC (ascii), BNG
	(bang-bang), CAF (format for CAFÉ project), DPC (usual
	display code), and TEL (TELUM packing).  Made in context
	of some research for the PPMF group and the BLOPS project.

January 1980:

	Unified module named GEN and program named GENCOP, in
	Cyber Pascal and assembler, partly inspired from NOS/BE
	Record Manager, partly from Claude Schnéegans' PESTUM
	protocol.

Before 1980:

	Several independant programs, most in Cyber COMPASS
	assembler, to handle code conversions.  A few tries to
	get some useful, unified, general approach, but with
	limited success.
