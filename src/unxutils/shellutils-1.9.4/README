This is a package of small shell programming utilities.  They are mostly
compliant with POSIX.2, where applicable.

The programs that can be built with this package are:
  basename date dirname echo env expr false groups id logname
  nice nohup pathchk printenv printf sleep stty tee test true
  tty uname who whoami yes
Some programs (uname, nice, nohup, and stty) are built and installed
only on systems that have the features to support them.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

If you are using a version of the Linux libc that predates 4.4.1,
you should get a newer version.  The old libraries contain getopt
functions that are incompatible with certain uses of the date program.
For instance, when built with the obsolete getopt functions, `date +%j'
will give a usage error instead of the expected result.

nice, stty, and uname require facilities not available on all systems;
`configure' detects this and does not try to compile them on systems
where those facilities are missing.
nohup requires nice.
su will be installed only if you do `make install' as root.

Many thanks to all the people who have taken the time to submit problem
reports and fixes.  Contributed changes are attributed in the ChangeLog
file.

These programs all recognize the `--version' option.  When reporting
bugs, please include in the subject line both the package name/version
and the name of the program for which you found a problem.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
